# Summum [![CurseForge][1]](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/summum)
Summum is a new mod, that adds tools that are indestructible, and do everything as efficiently as possible. It also adds armor that is indestructible and prevents you from taking ANY damage. That is right. With the sword OR new item; the wand, you can one-shot any mod, including the Ender Dragon, and Wither! With the chest piece of the armor, you have creative flight! Everything does have to have a catch, doesn't it? Since these items are so over-powered, they are designed to be end game items and require you to have already killed the ender dragon. All of the tools and what not are also very expensive.

## Pre-releases
Do you want access to beta, not available anywhere else pre-releases? Head over to the releases tab, to see and get the mod, before it is uploaded to CurseForge!
